== Coordinates and Board Orientation

Many of the endpoints described here take a coordinate (`x`, `y`, `newX`, `newY` etc.) to describe a location on the game board.

The board is oriented with its longest dimension running top to bottom, with the side rails on the left and right.

The origin `(0, 0)` is always defined as the _top left_ corner of the board. That is, the `x` value increases going across the board from left to right, while the `y` value increases going _down_ the length of the board.

TIP: Coordinates on the grid corresponding to an actual square, e.g. `(0, 1)`, we refer to as _board_ squares; coordinates not corresponding to an actual square due to the irregular shape of the board, e.g. `(0, 0)`, we refer to as _abyss_ squares.
